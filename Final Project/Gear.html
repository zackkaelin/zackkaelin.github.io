<h2>The Moab trip</h2>
<img src="imgs/IMG_7393.JPG">
<p>After a long hike through Arches National Park we finally made it to the famous Delicate Arch</p>

 <p>This was a really cool spot we stopped on a hike, there was tons of stuff to climb and I ended up running into someone from my rockclimbing class having a picnic with his girlfriend.</p>

<p>We sent this photo to everyone's parents as a joke right before we took off in a plane to go skydiving. The text we sent with it was "Well guys, it's been real, and we'll see you in the afterlife." Needless to say most of our parents did not think that was funny...</p>

<p>For those of you who don't know, Moab is located in Southern Utah in a huge desert, if you like to climb and view the wonders that earth can conjure up it's an excellent place to visit!</p>
