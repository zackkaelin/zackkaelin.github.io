    The Story

    Traveling has always been something that's been on my mind since I was a little kid. Growing up watching movies where the protagonist were adventuring in these beautiful worlds always made me wonder what was available outside of lil ol' Nampa.
</p>
<p>My parents were big travelers as well and were constantly taking us kids to National Parks across the country to see what the world had to offer. My mom liked to take photos and explore, and my dad was there for the history and to learn about the places we visited. Both of these things definitely rubbed off on me</p>

<p>When I finally was old enough to live on my own, I spent alot of time in the back of vans crossing the country with bands and getting to see even more amazing places, but mostly it was cities and the inside of concert venues, however this really solidied how much I enjoyed to travel, as I absolutely loved sleeping on a van bench and waking up in a different location every morning.</p>
<p>The most recent trip I did wasn't a touring obligation, but purely for my own personal pleasure, over springbreak a handful of lifelong friends and I packed up all of our camping gear and decided to take a roadtrip to Moab to skydive and hike through Arches National Park.</p>
