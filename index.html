 <h2>Introduction</h2>
 <p class="Introduction">Hi, and welcome to my travel blog, I've realized over the years that I've had the unique opportunity to do some really fun stuff and go some really amazing places wether it be by my own accord, or touring with bands. So this is how I plan to keep track of it all and hopefully inspire others to take up traveling as well. </p>

 <p> For now I've only got the content from my most recent trip readily available to post but I plan to update and as more as I go through my storage drives and go on other trips. Look out for lots of content from my summer Europe trip shortly!</p>
